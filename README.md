<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
<h3>The following code is part of a recipes project in the course The Odin Project. It is meant to be an exercise to help with real experience using HTML. It will not be pretty, per se, but it will get the job done. Should be a few basic pages of recipes, formatted well enough, and linking around to each other to demonstrate use with various elements and their attributes.</h3>
